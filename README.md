# Diabetes Readmission Prediction

In this project, we are predicting whether a diabetic patient would be readmitted to the hospital or not. It is important to know if a patient will be readmitted in some hospital. The reason is that the doctor or patient can change the treatment, in order to avoid a readmission.

In this context, we can see different objective functions for the problem. We can try to figure out situations where the patient will not be readmitted, or if they are going to be readmitted in less than or in more than 30 days.
