Big Data Winter 2020 Project on Dataset Analysis
In order driven markets prices are determined by the publication of orders to buy or sell shares. Examples of order driven markets around the world include Nasdaq OMX, London Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange and Australian Securities Exchange. In these markets, participants may submit limit orders or market orders. Limit orders specify the price at which a trader is willing to transact. Orders that do not execute immediately may be stored for later execution in a limit order book. Market orders execute immediately against orders in the limit order book. An understanding of the dynamic interplay between market and limit orders, and the state of the limit order book is important to traders, exchanges and regulators.

The limit order book represents a pool of trading interest over a range of prices. Standing buy (sell) orders with the highest bid (lowest ask) price have the highest probability of execution. The difference between the two best prices is the bid-ask spread. Competition between market participants ensures that in equilibrium the size of the spread is small.

Liquidity is the ability of market participants to trade large amounts of shares at low cost and quickly. Market resiliency (also known as liquidity replenishment) is the time component of liquidity and refers to how a market recovers after liquidity has been consumed. Resiliency is very important to market participants, particularly traders wishing to reduce their market impact costs by splitting large orders across time.

In this project, we determine the relationship between recent past order book events and future stock price mean reversion following shocks to liquidity. The extant literature suggests a number of factors to consider in the development of a liquidity replenishment model, including:

- Order arrival rate
- Bid-ask spread
- Transaction size
- Timing
- Trading volume

The data includes variables relating to the above factors.
